# final-ml-project
This repository contains my Final Machine Learning Project notebook. The project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline, including:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: Importing datasets, handling missing values, and data normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, feature relationships, and data distribution insights.

Model Building & Training: Implementation of supervised learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification) with scikit-learn or other frameworks.

Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE, plus confusion matrices and ROC curves where relevant.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use of GridSearchCV or other tuning techniques to optimize model performance.

Insights & Conclusions: Interpretation of results and final remarks on model performance and possible future improvements.
